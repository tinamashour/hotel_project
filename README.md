# hotel_project
In this project I designed a simple hotel system which asks a user hotel's name and guest name and shows the availabe spaces and rooms in the hotel. 
. Also, there are two rspec tests files, under rspec for testing. Feel free to play around with code and by following spec files you can implement th esystem easily.
note: the content of this project obtained from App Academy course.
